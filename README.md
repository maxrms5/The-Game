# The-Game
A 2D, top-down, JRPG-inspired video game **demo** made in the Unity Engine

# Description
This is the concept of a game that I made with some of my classmates in my senior year of high school. It was meant to be a JRPG-inspired game about a day in the
life of our protagonist, an atypical schoolboy. The initial game was going to be split into 6 stages, each representing some portion of a school day (class
periods, lunch, after school, etc.). The protagonist would go through these 6 different levels, fighting themed enemies with a Final-Fantasy-inspired combat
system. There would also be a very loose overarching story about the protagonist needing to save the world. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we only managed 
to create a demo of the first level and basic combat system. Below is a brief description of the game's plot. 

NOTE: This game was developed with a plot that was intentionally misleading and difficult to follow. 

# Levels
The game opens with a cutscene of our protagonist's dream. He is called upon by what he believes to be an omniscient, omnipresent being. This being tells him that
the world will end today unless he embarks upon a quest to stop it. The rest of the game then proceeds to never mention this cutscene again. 

Level 1: Environmental Science
  The first actual level, and the only current playable one, is a field trip to a swamp for an environmental science class. 
    Enemies: Frogs, Slimes, Glockodiles
    Boss: Giant Frog
    
Level 2: English
  The protagonist goes to his second period class, English. This class takes place in the school library.
    Enemies: Flying Books, The Dog in the Cap, Shakespear
    Boss: Steven Monarch
    
Level 3: Math
  The third period is math. Here, our protagonist takes another field trip to a casino to learn about probability.
    Enemies: Angels, Demons
    Boss: Giant Crab

Level 4: Lunch
  The fourth level takes place during lunch in the school cafeteria.
    Enemies: Lesser Lunch Ladies, Super Senior
    Boss: Lunch Lady
    
Secret Level: 
  Takes place if you venture into the bathroom during lunch. This level is an underwater style level, taking place in the sewer of the toilets. 
    Enemies: ???
    Boss: ???

Level 5: PE
  The fifth-period PE class. This class takes place in the school gymnasium, where the PE teacher, Mr. Schmeblin, resides.
    Enemies: Lesser Bullies
    Boss: Mr. Schmeblin
    
Level 6: Computer Science
  The 6th and final level was the most fleshed out of all the levels. It would take place during computer science class. The protagonist would get sucked into
  a computer, a la The Magic Schoolbus, and would have to find his way out. Along the way, he would encounter Computer Pixies that would try to stop him. After 
  successfully fighting his way through them, he would encounter the boss of the game: The Pixie Queen. Defeating her would trigger the end cutscene: The 
  protagonist goes to bed and is woken up the next day by the *exact* same vision from the beginning cutscene.
    Enemies: Computer Pixies
    Boss: The Pixie Queen
